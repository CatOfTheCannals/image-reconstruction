## image-reconstruction
Simulating noise in computed tomography. Reconstructing images with singular value decomposition-least squares cpp implementation.

### Link to report:

### Compiling with cmake from root dir:

`make`

Will create a `build`directory with executable in it.

### running main from build dir:

`./tp3 -params`

### Theoretical proof of concept:
`notebooks/svd_least_squares.ipynb`

### Experiments:
`notebooks/exp_varias_geos.ipynb`
